# Going Full Platform-Specific

At least until we get some proper consumer ARM hardware other

Original "quote" was: This shit's gonna have Rust in it.
Allegedly Deadpool said that.

Spent most of my career doing consulting work, except one small exception where
I actual worked for the same company that paid my salary.
Nowadays I mainly do software architecture but I'm a coder at heart.

### Tech

- Kotlin since 2015 (`M13`)
- Rust since 2018 (`1.26.0`)

![bg right](./images/kotlin-and-rust.png)

<!--
Standout features:
  - Kotlin
    - lateinit keyword (basically it's you knowing more than the compiler)
    - current visibility rules (which are simple but sometimes not enough)
      (there's currently a huge debate about additional rules on YouTrack)
  - Rust
    - main can return Result (no more need to create a wrapper for your)
      (actual main function which just adds boilerplate)
    - nicer match bindings for Option (no more requirement to specify)
      (variants as references)
-->

### Work

- IoT for media streaming (ðŸš„)
- Neobanking (until bankruptcy)
- Single point of failure for e-commerce
- Rearchitecting core insurance system

<!--
Just a small excerpt and overview:

- IoT
  - Basically treated trains like huge IoT devices
  - Had to contend with bad network infrastructure in Germany
  - Clever caching and batching required for monitoring data
- Neobanking
  - For gamers ðŸ¤ª
  - Spent more time debugging external core banking system
    than anything else
- e-commerce
  - Team ran the reverse proxy for the entire platform
  - 1/2 hour of outage was a loss of 2 million EUR
- Core Insurance System
  - Project was sadly cancelled before we could really get started
  - Although we did get some major observability and deployment wins
-->

### Projects

- The Movie Database API client
- Jaffree Fork
- ez-dyndns-rs
- ...

<!--
Most of my project seem to stem from Media Server 47, which is
the reason for this talk. Kinda fits the pattern TBH.

Jaffree is an FFmpeg API for JVM (wraps the ffmpeg executable).
Hostile fork because of fundamental differences between original creator
and me.

## Media Server 47

- A steaming server

<!-- main goals, ease of setup, autodetect everything -->
<!-- why??? low barrier to entry, trying new stuff -->

---

### Jellyfin

<!-- encoding capabilities, esp jellyfin-ffmpeg -->
<!-- mention .NET (bleh) -->

<!-- add jellyfin screenshot, stylized -->

---

### Plex

<!-- full media consumption platform for the home user -->
<!-- but hostile to the customer, e.g. registration required for HW transcoding -->

<!-- add plex promo art -->

---

### Others...

<!-- e.g. Emby, etc... -->

---

## Constraints

<!-- limited computing power -->
<!-- limited storage -->
<!-- hard requirement for faster than real time transcoding -->

---

### Consumer GPUs

<!-- Nvidia best -->
<!-- AMD catching up -->
<!-- Intel most common due to iGPUs -->

<!-- add GPU vendor graphics -->

---

## The Problem

<!-- detection of transcoding capabilities, manual config not acceptable -->
<!-- ask the transcoding hardware -->

---

### Utilities

<!-- provided by driver or extra packages -->
<!-- varying levels of usefulness -->

---

#### `vainfo`

<!-- complicated parsing required -->

---

#### `nvidia-smi`

<!-- output very limited, requires LUT -->
<!-- LUT is a PITA -->

---

## Rust

<!-- what is it -->
<!-- why is it appealing -->

---

### C (the protocol)

<!-- C not as a programming language but as a protocol -->
<!-- static or dynamic compilation -->

---

### Dynamic library loading

<!-- why is it preferable here -->
<!-- patterns -->

---

### Gotchas

<!-- working with native C structs -->
<!-- exposing native C structs -->
<!-- cleanup of memory -->

---

![bg 105%](./images/intermission-upscaled.png)

<!-- insert bollywood intermission text here -->

---

## Kotlin

<!-- full interop with the JVM ecosystem -->
<!-- need this for GraalVM -->
<!-- oh, and the Java Foreign Function and Memory Access API -->

---

### `jextract`

<!-- requires C header -->
<!-- produces base output -->

---

### Working with GraalVM

<!-- Use of a supporting framework advisable, e.g. Quarkus -->
<!-- Some static init gotchas, esp. for MethodHandle -->

---

### Alternatives

- JNI
- JNA
- UniFFI (by Mozilla)
- Kotlin/Native

<!--
- JNI
  - unsound memory model
  - clunky API
- JNA
  - prohibitively reflection heavy (not possible to get it work with GraalVM)
  - large runtime overhead
- UniFFI
  - already got an interface language: C
  - unsound resource management
- Kotlin/Native
  - don't want another garbage collector
  - when do I execute the GC?

Rust allows me to use the lingua franca of the OS, C, and brings a highly
optimized memory management model which lets me focus on the fun parts.
-->

---

## The Solution

<!-- let's ask the GPU vendor -->
<!-- and by that I mean we ask the native transcoding libraries -->

---

### VA-API

<!-- vaapi headers are easy to come by -->
<!-- well documented -->
<!-- have to enumerate the available device files yourself -->

---

#### CUVIDEC and NvEncode

<!-- two different styles of APIs (one C based, the other C++) -->
<!-- cuda headers not included by default, and licensed differently -->
<!-- powerful API, explain floating CUDA contexts -->

---

### Where's AMD?

<!-- actually covered by VAAPI -->
<!-- powerful opensource driver included in Linux kernel -->
<!-- mention inferior proprietary driver (only for specific use cases) -->

---

### Generating Rust bindings

<!-- mention required filtering of functions and structs -->
<!-- explain a bit about macros to handle calling and error handling -->

---

## Code

<!-- TODO: lead through code -->
<!-- start with going through the project structure -->
<!-- then the Rust code, choose one or two functions as examples -->
<!-- go through JVM bindings, jextract output, own workarounds -->
<!-- go through mapping to JVM types -->
<!-- explain final GraalVM build using Quarkus -->

---

## Demo

<!-- show off locally, via SSH on BEAST, and via SSH on SteamDeck -->
<!-- TODO: prepare video in advance in case something goes tits-up during the demo -->

---

## Takeaways

- The JVM is a powerful platform
- Now with powerful friends!
- Think outside the box!
